      role: 'Vice President',
      bio: `We're thrilled to introduce you to Hey, Blue! Board member and University of Virginia researcher/Professor Kyle Horstead Dobson.
  
  Kyle's work is all about forming authentic connections, and it beautifully aligns with our mission of fostering meaningful connections between police officers and their communities.
  
  📚 Kyle's Research Focus:
  He dives deep into the impact of authenticity in organizations, where often, employees' genuine selves are undervalued to ensure conformity. His research reveals that this practice comes at a significant cost -- reduced inclusion, engagement, commitment, and performance. This holds true across various settings, from police departments to schools.
  
  👨‍🏫 Interdisciplinary Approach:
  Kyle's approach spans multiple disciplines, with a primary focus on professions where employees dedicate themselves to serving others, often at the expense of their own well-being. His work began with police departments but has expanded to schools and other organizations. He collaborates with law enforcement agencies across states like Illinois, Texas, and Virginia, studying how officers' self-perception influences their connections, both within and outside their uniforms. In schools and other settings, he explores how leaders can create environments that encourage individuals to bring their true selves into their work.
  
  🔬 A Research Process That Makes a Difference:
  Kyle's research journey begins with qualitative insights gathered through immersion in organizations, involving interviews and field observations. This groundwork leads to the development of novel theories. He then tests these theories using experiments, including interventions in field experiments. His ultimate goal is to enhance our scholarly and practical understanding of how organizations can support employees' authenticity to create more inclusive and effective workplaces.

      role: 'Co-Founder',
      bio: `Ayana's early life was shaped in Brownsville, Brooklyn, an area known for its challenges and, at one point, considered the "murder capital of the world." During her formative years, her interactions with the police were marred by negative experiences. It wasn't until the year 2000, when she met her husband, an NYPD police officer, that she was given the opportunity to see the human side of policing. This pivotal moment ignited her passion to bridge the gap between communities and law enforcement, paving the way for transformative change.
  
  🌱 In 2016, Ayana embarked on a remarkable journey by founding The Verdi EcoSchool, located in Melbourne, FL. This unique institution reimagines education from Pre-K through High School with a not-for-profit Urban Farm School model. What sets it apart is its holistic approach, seamlessly blending agriculture, social-emotional learning, place-based and project-based education. However, what truly defines The Verdi EcoSchool is its unwavering belief in the power of community involvement as an integral part of the learning experience.
  
  Ayana's journey as a change agent and innovator resonates deeply with Hey, Blue!'s mission, which is to create a more equitable criminal legal system and emphasize community involvement in the learning experience. Shared values such as community involvement, education innovation, and empowerment underscore the common goals of both Hey, Blue! and The Verdi EcoSchool.

She's been recognized as a The Drexel Fund Fellow, a The Yass Prize semi-finalist (in collaboration with Forbes and The Center for Education Reform), and has even received a 2023 Nomination for Humanitarian of the Year by the Space Coast Black Chamber of Commerce. Her relentless pursuit of improving education echoes her dedication to making a positive impact on society.

These relationships create a ripple effect of positive change that reaches far beyond the mentorship itself.
  
  🤝 Hey, Blue! & Big Brothers Big Sisters:
  Bryan volunteered to join the Hey, Blue! Board of Directors because we share a common belief: To start a systemic change of culture in Policing, it must start with the reconceptualization that police officers must be servants to their community from day one. One action step ANY police department can take towards achieving this goal is for police departments to partner with Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, especially participating in their "Bigs With Badges." initiative. This way officers can have greater, more profound impact in the community they serve.
  
  🔍 Bigs With Badges Initiative:
  One remarkable initiative within Big Brothers Big Sisters is "Bigs With Badges." This program unites law enforcement officers with children in mentoring relationships. It's an incredible opportunity to bridge the gap between police departments and their communities.
